# Football-leagues-logos
The objective of this program is to download the first 100 images of the logos of leagues from a football API. 
Therefore, using axios I got the data from a football api. Then I passed headers using axios. Then downloaded the first 100 images.
Also, I downloaded the images of squad players of the football team manchester united and stored them in a separate folder with each file name being the player's 
'lastname'.js and their images in the file. The program also uses axios to download to return a promise and promise.all to fulfil the promises.
